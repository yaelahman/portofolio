Recently [Tim MacDonald](https://github.com/timacdonald) has contributed to creating a `fake()` function that can be used globally. Using this function, we can easily prototype, test, and generate data.

Here I will directly model it for users. Remember, there is no such thing as a table setup, let alone a factory.

```html
@for ($i = 0; $i < 10; $i++)
<ul>
    <li>Name: {{ fake()->name() }}</li>
    <li>Email: {{ fake()->email() }}</li>
    <li>Phone: {{ fake()->phoneNumber() }}</li>
</ul>
@endfor
```

Or for example "single record":

```html
<article>
    <h1>{{ str(fake()->sentence())->title() }}</h1>
    <div>
        @foreach (fake()->paragraphs(12) as $item)
        <p>{{ $item }}</p>
        @endforeach
    </div>
</article>
```

Hopefully, this information will be useful.
