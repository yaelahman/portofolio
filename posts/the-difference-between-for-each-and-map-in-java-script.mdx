If you've been playing around with JavaScript lately, you might have come across two Array methods that seem to function the same.

### Array.prototype.forEach() - forEach

According to [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/), The forEach() method will execute the provided function once for each element of the array.

In short, use `forEach`, if you **do not want** to manipulate the original data, or the output of the array.

Because basically, this method doesn't return anything, yep, it doesn't return anything, but it will just call the provided function on each element in the array that we have.

Here is an example of its use.

```js
const users = [
    { firstname: 'Irsyad', lastname: 'A. Panjaitan', age: 25 },
    { firstname: 'Alex', lastname: 'Smith', age: 29 },
    { firstname: 'Sri', lastname: 'A. Rahayu', age: 26 },
];

users.forEach((user) => {
    console.log(user.firstname);
});

// expected output: 'Irsyad'
// expected output: 'Alex'
// expected output: 'Sri'
```

### Array.prototype.map() - Map

According to [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/), The map() method creates a new array filled with the results of the provided function call on each return element in the array.

In short, use `map` if you **want** to change the data obtained from the array.

Consider the following array.

```js
const users = [
    { firstname: 'Irsyad', lastname: 'A. Panjaitan', age: 25 },
    { firstname: 'Alex', lastname: 'Smith', age: 29 },
    { firstname: 'Sri', lastname: 'A. Rahayu', age: 26 },
];
```

If you look at the array above, each of them has keys named `firstname` and `lastname`. What if we combine `firstname` and `lastname` into `name`.

Take a look at the following example.

```js
users.map((user) => {
    return {
        name: `${user.firstname} ${user.lastname}`,
        age: user.age,
    };
});

/*
 expected output: Array [
  { name: 'Irsyad A. Panjaitan', age: 25 },
  { name: 'Alex Smith', age: 29 },
  { name: 'Sri A. Rahayu', age: 26 }
]
*/
```

If we look, from the output, it is clear that they are different, `map` returns an array back, while `forEach` does not.

Here is another example.

```js
const numbers = [2, 3, 4, 5];

numbers.forEach((number) => {
    console.log(number * 5);
});

// expected output: 10
// expected output: 15
// expected output: 20
// expected output: 25
```

If we use map, then what is returned is data in the form of an array.

```js
const numbers = [2, 3, 4, 5];

numbers.map((number) => number * 5);
// expected output: Array [ 10, 15, 20, 25 ]
```

It's clear the difference between the two functions, **map** will return an array back, while **forEach** will not.
