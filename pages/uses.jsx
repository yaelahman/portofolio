                            I get asked a lot about the things I use to build
                            software, stay productive, or buy to fool myself
                            into thinking I’m being productive when I’m really
                            just procrastinating. Here’s a big list of all of my
                            favorite stuff.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Workstation</h2>
                        <p>
                            Here I will explain about the tools that I use at
                            work, because I am a teacher at Parsinta, I will
                            also explain everything that happens there.

                            <p>
                                For now, the <strong>Apple M1 Chip</strong>{' '}
                                (8-Core CPU, 8-Core GPU) with{' '}
                                <strong>256GB</strong> storage and{' '}
                                <strong>8GB</strong> RAM is enough for my daily
                                work.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Incidentally because I subscribe to{' '}
                                <strong>iCloud</strong>, so I don't need to buy
                                up to 1 TB. And also it's not a cheap price for
                                now I think.

                            <p>
                                In the past year, this is the mic I used when
                                recording video tutorials at{' '}

                                is also from Rode. And to connect my voice so
                                that it can be heard properly, I use{' '}
                                <strong>Single-Channel Audio Interface</strong>.

                                You know that the iPhone 14 just came out, but
                                I'm still comfortable with this. And more
                                importantly, all my needs were met and that was
                                more than enough. <br /> And of course I will
                                not be stuck with the words "This is the best
                                iPhone we ever made" ⸺ <strong>J</strong>/
                                <strong>K</strong>.

                            I feel this is the most part of all, because I care
                            and are very serious about what I am interested in.

                            <h4>Visual Studio Code</h4>
                            <p>
                                Right now, this is my main text editor, nothing
                                else but this. Before using this editor, I used
                                sublime text which was about 6 years old.
                                Starting from early 2020, I started using visual
                                studio code and I think, I can be comfortable
                                here even now.

                            <h4>iTerm</h4>
                            <p>
                                I’m honestly not even sure what features I get
                                with this that aren’t just part of the macOS
                                Terminal but it’s what I use.
                            </p>
                            <h4>Warp</h4>
                            <p>
                                Apart from using <strong>iTerm</strong>. I
                                sometimes use Warp, yes it all depends on the
                                mood too.
                            </p>
                            <h4>TablePlus</h4>
                            <p>
                                This is the most robust tool I've ever used to
                                interface with mysql. But unfortunately, it's
                                not free. So I have to buy it. When I bought it,
                                it was still around <strong>$79</strong> and
                                that's what I chose was basic. Because also the
                                device I'm currently using is only one.
                            </p>
                            <h4>Laravel Forge</h4>
                            <p>
                                I'm too lazy to mess around with the server, so
                                I'm thinking of just subscribing to Laravel
                                Forge. I took the "Hobby" package for now which
                                was $12/mo, previously I used "Growth" which was
                                $19/mo, but I think it's useless for now, so I
                                downgrade.
                            </p>
                            <h4>Amazon S3</h4>
                            <p>
                                I won't talk much about this issue, because I
                                only use it as storage for my website.
                            </p>
                            <h4>Figma</h4>
                            <p>
                                For creating thumbnail series or open graph
                                images, <strong>Figma</strong> is the tool I use
                                and the only one. Previously I used{' '}
                                <strong>Sketch</strong>, but you know it's not
                                free. But Figma do.
                            </p>
                            <h4>Browser</h4>
                            <p>
                                For work I use <strong>Firefox</strong>, and if
                                I just want to browse, I choose{' '}
                                <strong>Safari</strong>.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <h2>Productivity</h2>
                        <p>
                            I feel this is the most part of all, because I care
                            and are very serious about what I am interested in.
                        </p>

                            <h4>Raycast</h4>
                            <p>
                                I used to use Alfred before, but since I know
                                how amazing Raycast is, I feel very stupid if I
                                don't use this tool.
                            </p>
                            <h4>Notes</h4>
                            <p>
                                I know there are better tools than this, but you
                                know, I'm comfortable with this. so it's hard
                                for me to move.
                            </p>
                            <h4>Typora</h4>
                            <p>
                                Apart from making video tutorials, I also write
                                books. So I need an application that supports
                                the name Markdown. So typeora is my choice for
                                now. It's not free, when I bought it it was
                                still around $15.
                            </p>
                            <h4>Xnapper</h4>
                            <p>
                                I know, every computer must have a built-in
                                screenshot, but I think xnapper makes my work
                                more productive by not opening Figma every time
                                I want to post everywhere.
                            </p>
                            <h4>1Password</h4>
                            <p>
                                I know there are a lot of password managers, but
                                I only stick with 1 password and it's been 3
                                years. Because now there are lots of websites or
                                applications that offer what is called
                                two-factor authentication. So I think using
                                1password is easier to not download other
                                applications.
                            </p>
                            <h4>DaVinci Resolved</h4>
                            <p>
                                I use this tool to edit all the videos in
                                Parsinta. Previously I did use screensflow, obs,
                                and until I realized that DR was more powerful.

                        <p>
                            For now, that's all I wear and I have. Maybe I'll
                            update this if I use something else.
